::: {#review .collapse .multi-collapse}

### Goal: Implement 4096 bit integers
- My responsibility
  - I will provide 1 week of instruction on rings, number theory, and programming languages.
  - I will provide an autograder Containerfile
- Your responsibility
  - You will implement a 4096 bit unsigned integer in C89 as:
    - "4096_t.c" implementation file, and
    - "4096_t.h" header file.
  - You will store your "4096_t" files in the "4096_t" folder on your "crypto" GitHub repository.

# Resources

- [The BigAdd lab](bigadd.html)
    - The "Header" entry formed my starter code.
- [My Finite Slides](finite.html)
    - Contextual background
- [My BigNum Slides](bignum.html)
  - I used this, and its references. Try scroll mode (press 'r')
  - I think my slides are suitable for multiplication.
  - Division is something of a challenge problem. 
    - I would begin with the following:
    - [Wikipedia Division Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm)
        - I used this and Stack Overflow to implement division.
        - I used a variety of bitshifts.

# BigMul&nbsp;<a class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#bigmul" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="bigmul">Show</a>

::: {#bigmul .collapse .multi-collapse}

- I find the following bulletin summary the most helpful to making a bigmul implementation:
    - I Made a pointer to a `uint32_t`
    - `uint32_t *alias;
    - Set it equal to the location of some array of `uint64_t`
    - `uint32_t *alias = &array;
    - Copied elements of the "alias" into 64 bit values.
    - `uint64_t tmp = alias[5];`
    - Multiplied, tracking significance.
- Versus in class, I will note I made `uint32_t` aliases for all operands.
- Additional, I made a uint64_t twice as large as the input arrays, to hold intermediate results.

```{.C}
uint64_t bigmul(uint64_t *in0, uint64_t *in1, uint64_t *out) {
    size_t i, j;
    uint64_t wrk[S*2 + 1];
    uint32_t *al0 = (uint32_t *)in0, *al1 = (uint32_t *)in1 , *alw = (uint32_t *)wrk, *alo = (uint32_t *)out;
```

# BigDiv&nbsp;<a class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#bigdiv" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="bigdiv">Show</a>

::: {#bigdiv .collapse .multi-collapse}

*While I hope all students complete BigDiv, it is a de facto challenge problem - I found no "easy" solution, and understand it is a comparatively complex system.*

- I implemented division as a recursive long division with considerable error handling.
- I began by aligning the most significant non-zero bit, which was non-trivial but simple enough.
- You should write the following functions:

```{.C}
uint64_t bigdiv(uint64_t *num, uint64_t *den, uint64_t *quo, uint64_t *rem) {
    /* Your code here */
    return 0;
}

uint64_t bigquo(uint64_t *num, uint64_t *den, uint64_t *quo) {
    uint64_t rem[S];
    bigdiv(num,den,quo,rem);
    return 0;
}

uint64_t bigrem(uint64_t *num, uint64_t *den, uint64_t *rem) {
    uint64_t quo[S];
    bigdiv(num,den,quo,rem);
    return 0;
}
```

- I additionally wrote the following helper functions.
- These are not all required, or even recommended, simply what I used.
- They are not debugged - some errors are likely handled within my `bigdiv`
    - I expect many off-by-one errors from the comments, which I added just for this document.

```{.C}
/* Detemine the log of a 4096bit in base 2^64 */
uint64_t biglog(uint64_t *in) {
    uint64_t log = S;
    while (log && !in[--log]) { }
    return log;
}

/* Detemine the log of a 64bit in base 2 */
uint64_t lillog(uint64_t in) {
    uint64_t log = 0;
    while ((in >> log++) && log < 64) {}
    return log;
}

/* Find the address of the most significant bit of a 4096bit integer */
uint64_t getmsb(uint64_t *n) {
    uint64_t b, l;
    b = biglog(n);
    l = lillog(n[b]);
    return b * 64 + l;
}

/* Return 64 bits from a 4096 bit integer, begging at bit `ind` */
uint64_t get_64(uint64_t *n, uint64_t ind) {
    uint64_t b = ind / 64, l = ind % 64;
    return (n[b] << (64 - l)) + (b ? (n[b - 1] >> l) : 0);
}
```

# Tester&nbsp;<a class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#tester" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="tester">Show</a>

::: {#tester .collapse .multi-collapse}

- I am providing the following Containerfile, which will serve as a minimal autograder
    - I pivoted back to Alpine because Ubuntu was slow.

```{.email filename="Containerfile"}
FROM alpine 

RUN apk add build-base gcc curl python3

RUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cd-c89/crypto/refs/heads/main/4096_t/4096_t.h -o 4096_t.h

RUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cd-c89/crypto/refs/heads/main/4096_t/tester.c -o tester.c

RUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cd-c89/crypto/refs/heads/main/4096_t/tester.py -o tester.py

COPY 4096_t.c .
```

- All three of the these files were previous introduced in the [BigAdd](./bigadd.html]) lab.

#### Usage

- I built my container via:

```email
podman build -t tester .
```

- I tested my code via:

```email
podman run tester python3 tester.py
```

- If the above script returns the following you are done:
    - Upload your code to your GitHub on which I am a collaborator.
- I will review the most recent version prior to the due date.
```email
ADD passes.
MUL passes.
QUO passes.
REM passes.
```

#### Testing

-   When the container is built, it copies in `4096_t.c`
-   Within the container, `tester.py`:
    -   Compiles `tester.c` as C89 with appropriate `gcc` flags.
        -   `tester.c` is dependent on both your `4096_t.c` and my `4096_t.h`
    -   Creates two values of size less than 2048 bits.
    -   Performs all relevant operations over these values, check the results.
