# Announcements

- **Welcome** to Computing Security
- **Action Items**:
  - Enigma assignment

# Homework

- The first homework, "Enigma", is ready after this class.
  - Due Monday, 14 Jul at midnight AOE
  - The infamous CS1 hw, now in a good language!
  - Mostly just get the toolchain working.
  
# Today

- Reintroduce the technologies
  - `podman`
  - `vim`
  - `gcc`
  - `git`
  
# What is Podman?

- **Definition:**
  - Platform to develop, ship, and run applications in isolated containers.
- **Benefits:**
  - Portability, consistency across environments.
- **Editorializing:**
  - Probably all code should be written in a container now that they exist.

# In practice:

- **Windows** only
  - Run `wsl --install -d ubuntu` command once
  - Run `wsl` to... enter wsl.
  - Run `sudo apt update` once
  - Run `sudo apt upgrade` once
  - Run `sudo apt install podman`
  - Use `podman` commands within WSL

# In practice:

- **Mac** only
  - Use podman desktop installer
  - Before using containers, run
    -  `podman machine start`
    -  If it didn't work, may need to `podman machine init`
  - This may create a large file on your device
    - `podman-machine-default-arm64.raw`

# In practice:

- Podman works well without hacks on Linux
  - In fairness, the goal is have access to Linux anyways.
  - "Linux" search term shows ~100 jobs in Portland area
  - vs. 300:Python, 200:SQL, 100:Tableau, 200:R but the first is HVAC?
    - "HVAC/R Service Technician"

# Podman

- Podman solves the problem of writing code on one computer and running it another.
- Simply specify a Podman image
  - a description of a imaginary computer
- Podman will pretend to be that computer
- We can run code "inside" Podman
  - Code in the container can't tell it's running inside Podman

# Inside:

```email
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/tmp$ echo "hello world" > file.txt
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/tmp$ cat file.txt
hello world
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/tmp$ podman start -l ; podman exec -it -l cat file.txt
e12a46ee0bbe161541597b6b807b79a86e81fcae59c1bcb614e83af1493d2153
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory
```

# Images

- Something we `podman run -it` is an _image_
  - It is a template that corresponds to many possible pretend computers
  - I think of them like object oriented class
  - They define something that could be

# Containers

- Each time we run said command, we have a different _container_
  - They have different file systems
  - Things we install don't persist to future `run` instances.
  - I think of them like objects of a class
  - Like '1' instead of 'integer'
  - They are actually existing, running code.

# Reuse

- On Enigma, probably:
  - You opened a container.
  - You wrote some code in vim.
  - You compiled the code.
  - You ran the executable.
  - The executable deorbited a space station. /s
  - You closed the container and went to touch grass.

# Attach

- After touching grass, you
  - Came back to your PC
  - Had no graceful way to continue working on the code you wrote.
- We solve this with attachment and detachment.

# Servers

- One of the most common ways to use containers is web dev.
- They are easier to think of as:
  - A program, which
  - Hosts a webpage, which
  - Happens to need to run somewhere
    - That somewhere is a command line
    - Inside a pretend computer (container).
    
# Sample

- Docker maintains a sample container.
  - Podman is busy being free and open source.
- Try this:
```email
podman run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker
```
- You can probably find it at this link:
  - [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

# Breakdown

| Command    | Explanation |
| -------- | ------- |
| `podman`  | do something with containers   |
| `run` | run a new container     |
| `-d`    | detach - we'll cover this next    |
| `-p`  | This is port forward... |
| `8080:80` | 80 is where websites usually live
|           | 8080 is where we went (:8080)
| `docker/...` | Name of an image |

# Ports

- Ports aren't the point, but
- We should demystify.
- Change `8080:80` to `8083:80`
```email
podman run -d -p 8083:80 docker/welcome-to-docker
```
- Change the link as well.
  - [http://127.0.0.1:8083/](http://127.0.0.1:8083/)
  
# Two pages

- Wait a minute...
  - There's a webpage at 8080
  - There's a webpage at 8083
  - They're both from the same image.
  - They were started in the same command line (maybe)
- That is two containers running concurrently.
  - Enter `-d`
  
# Detach

- When we run an image with the `-d` flag, it:
  - Created and ran as any other container, but
  - Runs "in the background"
    - Control does not change to container
    - It runs only its start command
    - It's just like a remote web server.

# Detach Dev

- A perhaps nicer way to write code is
  - Create and detach a container
  - Leave it running or whatever
  - Use other `podman` commands to:
    - Pop into the container and e.g. `vim`
    - Transfer files in or out
    - Pause and restart to save resources.


# ps

- When fiddling about with containers...
  - It's good to know who they are (names)
  - And what they do (command)
- We can use `podman ps`
```email
podman ps
```
- We see two servers (nginx) running 
  
```email
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                      COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                         NAMES
7d6af09131b5  docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, 80/tcp  confident_darwin
2e1b9f844dcd  docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes  0.0.0.0:8083->80/tcp, 80/tcp  adoring_shamir
```

# ps -a

- You may also have many containers
- `podman ps -a` to see old containers.
```email
podman ps -a
```
- I had many such containers!
  - 4 GB worth, to be exact
- Clean them all up with prune
```email
podman system prune
```
- System = containers, images, everything

# exec -it

- If there's a detached container running
- We can execute commands in that container.
- You only have to specify enough of the name or id to be unique.
  - A server at 8080 beginning with id 7...
```email
podman exec -it 7d echo hello
```
- This returns hello, directly, without switching into the container.


# /bin/sh

- So far, I haven't found a container without `/bin/sh`
- The Linux command line, more or less
  - `bash` > `sh`, but sometimes only `sh` available
- Get an interactive command prompt via
```email
podman exec -it 7d /bin/sh
```
- This is roughly the same as `run -it`
  - But on an existing container, not a base image


# **NOTE**

- In this example, a webserver is kept running.
- By default, containers can stop running.
- If a container isn't under `podman ps`:
    - Find it with `podman ps -a`
    - Start it with `podman start` by name
- Restarts the last container with `vim`:
```email
podman start -l ; podman exec -it -l vim 
```

# vim

- I've adopted a strong preference for just using `vim`
  - When I exit `vim`, I implicitly exit the container.
  - Feels better than typing `exit`, to me
- So if we create an image with vim, we can
```email
podman exec -it 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦_𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 vim
```
- And go from there.

# Today

- Reintroduce the technologies
  - &check; `podman`
  - `vim`
  - `gcc`
  - `git`

# IDEs

- At some point in time, code started being written in IDEs.
  - Integrated design environments.
  - To me, the first one was Eclipse (for Java)
- That time was shortly before the 2008 financial crises
  - Don't put in the course evals I blame Eclipse for the Great Recession
    

# Why Vim fr tho?

- It is a command at command line
- It can be installed in containers


# Containerfile
- Here's the "Containerfile" I'm using today:
```{.email filename="Containerfile"}
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt update && apt install gcc vim -y
```

# Ubuntu
- I use Ubuntu
```{.email filename="Containerfile"}
FROM ubuntu
```
- It's a bit annoying Alpine requires separately grabbing libc to print

# apt
- Ubuntu uses `apt` to manage packages, like `gcc` and `vim`
- Images are notorious for having out-of-date package listings
```{.email filename="Containerfile"}
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt update
```
- This tells Ubuntu to look for the latest & greatest

# &&
- We use && to update and install at once
- We use `apt install` to... install `gcc` from `apt`

```{.email filename="Containerfile"}
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt update && apt install gcc vim -y
```
- This avoids a container updating, going to sleep, and packages falling out of date.
  - Apparently that actually happens on cloud, somehow

# -y
- We list whatever other packages we need and also...
- `-y` as by default `apt` asks us if we're sure
```{.email filename="Containerfile"}
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt update && apt install gcc
```
- Without `-y`, `apt` will wait for us to type
  - We often use podman in scripts or commands where it gets stuck, so use `-y`



# Usage

- I usually enter a container via
```email
podman exec -it 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦_𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 vim
```
- Or often with a filename
```email
podman exec -it 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦_𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 vim samp.c
```
- From there I do a few things...

- We didn't save samp.c, we will:
    - Use CTRL+`w` to change "window"
    - We will use any `vim` movement key, like `j`
      - `j` moves down one "thing" 
      - usually line, now a window
    - We will use ESC + `:w` to write the file
    - Then return to terminal CTRL+`w`+`k`

# Today

- &check; Introduce the course
  - &check; The C Programming Language
  - &check; Cryptography + Cryptocurrency
- Introduce the technologies
  - &check; `podman`
  - &check; `vim`
  - `gcc`
  - `git`

# GCC

- Developed for the C language to make an open source operating system in 1987.
- Mainly around today for the C language to make an open source operating system (Linux)
- (The C language was invented to write an operating system).
- `python` is written in GCC C
```python
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman run -it python
Python 3.13.1 (main, Dec  4 2024, 20:40:27) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
```

# Great freeware

- Many legendary programs created using GCC:
  - HTTPD & NGINX, which serve a majority of webtraffic
  - Every major Linux and FreeBSD distribution
  - Major browsers like Firefox and Chromium
    - Firefox is on `clang` now but that's new
  - GNU Bash and Coreutils, like `cat`, `ls`, `rm`
  - Bitcoin Core
  
# Compilation

- Like `python` or `podman` or `vim`, GCC is a command - `gcc`
- `gcc` takes at least one argument: a filename, usually of a C file
- GCC takes this C file and makes an executable 
  - a program, sort of
- Executables run as command with `./` prefix
  - This differs from `python` which runs a script **without** creating a corresponding program.

# .py vs .c

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(Python) --> B[fname.py file]
  B --> C[python fname.py]
  C --> D{hello world}
  E(C) --> F[fname.c  file]
  F --> G[gcc fname.c -o ename]
  G --> H[./ename]
  H --> I{hello world}
```

- _You only have to compile once to have the executable forever._
- _Most programs are executables, not scripts._

# Options

- `gcc` has many options
  - `-o` specifies the name of the output file
  - `-std` specifies the C version (there's a few)
  - `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic` set warnings - I use all 4
  - `-w` stop all warnings.
  - `-O2` to compile more slowly to make faster code

# C89/99

- I prefer to write C89/99 compliant code
  - Later code is a bit too unclear for me
  - C89/99 have everything I need in a systems language
  - Most latter features I'd just switch to Python anyways
- It tends to be easier to write compilers for C89 as well...



# Podracing

- Quickly pop back into our container.
  - Bookmark this page, save the text in a script, etc.

```email
podman start -l ; podman exec -it -l vim samp.c
```

- Pop open `:term` and run
```email
gcc samp.c -std=c89
```

- My code runs fine. Let's break it.

# C++ //

- Many C++ features have been adopted by C
- Perhaps the most famous is C++ comments.

```{.C filename="samp.c"}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        /* This is a C89 style comment */
        // This is a C++ style comment
        printf("hi\n");
        return 0;
}
```

# std=c89

- My `vim` window was tiny and I didn't want to resize it
- I opened a new terminal and tested 
```
gcc samp.c --std=c89
```

```bash
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/crypto/c89_99$ podman exec -it -l gcc samp.c --std=c89
samp.c: In function 'main':
samp.c:5:9: error: C++ style comments are not allowed in ISO C90
    5 |         // This is a C++ style comment
      |         ^
samp.c:5:9: note: (this will be reported only once per input file)
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~/crypto/c89_99$ podman exec -it -l gcc samp.c
```

# -Wall etc

- The other flags help "keep you honest"
  - If we wanted shortcuts, we'd use Python
  - We want to be percise [sic]
- Try it:
```bash
gcc samp.c --std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -O2
```

# Whoops
- You don't want to find these problems latter.
```email
samp.c: In function 'main':
samp.c:5:9: error: C++ style comments are not allowed in ISO C90
    5 |         // This is a C++ style comment
      |         ^
samp.c:5:9: note: (this will be reported only once per input file)
samp.c:3:14: error: unused parameter 'argc' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
    3 | int main(int argc, char **argv) {
      |          ~~~~^~~~
samp.c:3:27: error: unused parameter 'argv' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
    3 | int main(int argc, char **argv) {
      |                    ~~~~~~~^~~~
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
```
- Python needs `-Wall` for intro programming classes!

# Benefits of C89

- In C89, we must declare all variables at the beginning of functions.
- Every "confused" Enigma I saw had massive variable name proliferation
- Python lets you do this.
  - I argue this is Python preventing you from *learning to program*
- The C89 language standard will protect you from writing bad code.

# Expectation

```{.C filename="cipher.c"}
#include <stdio.h>

char cipher(char c, int i) {
    return (c - 'A' + i) % 26 + 'A';
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int i;
    if (argc < 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    for (i = 0 ; argv[1][i]; i++) {
        argv[1][i] = cipher(argv[1][i], i);
    }
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

# Reality

- These flags **prevent unused variables**
- These flags **require variable declaration** early.
  - We have to think, plan etc.


# Example

- Variable declared, not used.

```{.C}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int i;
    /* if (argc < 1) {
        return 1;
    } */
    for (i = 0 ; argv[1][i]; i++) {
        argv[1][i] = cipher(argv[1][i], i);
    }
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

- We can segmentation fault from an out-of-bounds error on argv.

# Example

- Variable declaration in function
```{.C}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0 ; argv[1][i]; i++) {
        argv[1][i] = cipher(argv[1][i], i);
        int i++; 
    }
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

- Prevents ill-formed variable changes.
  - Like .js `const` convention

# Example

- `-Werror=char-subscripts`
```{.C}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char i;
    for (i = 0 ; argv[1][i]; i++) {
        argv[1][i] = cipher(argv[1][i], i);
    }
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```
- Ensures we can read strings of 255+ chars.

# Example

- Not technically wrong.

```{.C}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char i;
    if (argc < 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    char *input_string = argv[1];
    for (i = 0 ; argv[1][i]; i++) {
        argv[1][i] = cipher(argv[1][i], i);
    }
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

- But why?

# Example

- Actually wrong - output_string has no size.

```{.C}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char i;
    if (argc < 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    char *output_string;
    for (i = 0 ; argv[1][i]; i++) {
        output_string[i] = cipher(argv[1][i], i);
    }
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

- C89 catches this, others don't.

# Takeaway

- As a *second* (or latter language)
- Learn C by turning on compiler flags and writing code.
  - As a first language, use this little trick called "learn Python instead"
- With practice, the correspondences will become obvious.
  - At that time, you will understand computing.

# Practice to Perform

- My take: learn C89 in class
  - Cultivate a disciplined coding practice
  - Work on older devices
  - Understand old code
  - Understand how computers work
- Learn modern C via Stack Overflow
  - Understand how to code in practice

# Today

- Reintroduce the technologies
  - &check; `podman`
  - &check; `vim`
  - &check; `gcc`
  - `git`
  
# Git

<ul>
<li> Git was invented... to store the C language source code for an open source operating system (Linux)</li>
<li> It is de facto the only way in the universe to store code other than "on my HDD/SSD"</li>
<li> It is also a very good way to
    <ul>
    <ol>
    <li>Store Containerfiles</li>
    <li>Steadily build a codebase</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
</li>

# As a command

- Git corresponds, like the others, to a command: `git`
  - It is common now to use other techniques, but the command remains extremely **stable**
- Quoth GitHub, the first and greatest of the collaboration tools:

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/connecting-to-github"><blockquote>
If you want a lot of control and flexibility, you can use the command line.
</blockquote></a>

# Henceforth

- This week: Macros homework
- This code will be used in the final project
- Just like all the rest of the code we write this term
- Store it on one big ole GitHub repo

# Fun fact

- Despite Big Command Line lobbying to get us to use `git`
- There is no graceful way to set repositories to private at commandline
  - There's a tactic doing API calls through the GitHub CLI
  - What are we even doing, open a browser
- In 2024, browsers are decisively more secure than the commandline

# Private

- I recommend:
  - Pop in browser
  - Make a private github repo, like "crypto"
    - Add me as a collaborator
  - Name it "crypto"
  - Probably use a folder per week for hws
    - Maybe also labs, or just keep those local
    
# GitHub x Podman

- Over time, we'll try to operationalize code better and better
- Eventually, I plan to ask for a container in "ghcr"
  - GitHub Container Registry
- In the meantime, I'd just keep a Containerfile at top level in your "crypto" repo.
