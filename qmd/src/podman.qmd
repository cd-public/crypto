# The Great Work

- Thesis Title
  - Mining Secure Behavior of Hardware Designs 
- Plain English
  - Just as there are bugs in code that makes software, modern hardware is also written in code and therefore may contain bugs. I find these bugs. 

# How To Do It

- After ~10 years of systems research I've convinced myself [only two things](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/) that really matter:

  - Pointers, and
  - Recursion 

- Recursion isn't too bad... 

```py
>>> exp = lambda b, n : b if n == 1 else b*exp(b,n-1)
>>> exp(2,8)
256
```

# Pointers

- Pointers are a beast, but without them nothing makes sense!

UnboundLocalError:
<blah blah blah error messages>
```

# Insight

- **Definition:**
  - Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses.
  - Recursion: Functions calling themselves to solve sub-problems.
- **Importance:**
  - Core to efficient algorithms and memory management in low-level programming.
  

# Python and Pointers

- **Why not .py (.js, .java, .cs, .cpp, etc)?**
  - These languages _abstract_ memory.
  - This abstraction makes computation **unclear**
  - This lack of clarity:
    - Adversely impacts education
    - Complicates low-level design
    - Leads to low performance
  - Good languages (except Java) but not for us

# C and Pointers

- **Why C?**
  - Everyone hates C because it makes us think...
  - And thinking is **hard**.
  - But there exist problems (security) for which careful thought is necessary.
  - Learning C makes us better [Blub](https://paulgraham.com/avg.html) programmers.
- **I claim:** You needn't use C in real life.

# C is for Clear

- C does not _obscure_ what a computer is doing.
- This lack of obscurity allows for greater precision.
- This greater precision can be used to achieve security goals.
- **Advantages of C:**
  - Fine-grained control over memory.
  - Essential for systems programming.

# This class

- I am a systems security researcher and I discerned two core gaps in Willamette CS education:
  - Systems, and
  - Security
- Teaching systems alone can be boring or tedious.
- Teaching security alone can be defuse and ethereal.

# Learning Objectives


-  Differentiate confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
-  Apply modular arithmetic to computational systems.
-  Apply recursion and a pointers to programming problems.
-  Articulate the impossibility of distributed consensus.
-  Understand a low-level systems language.

# SHA

- **SHA Basics:**
  - Cryptographic hash function family.
  - Input data into fixed-size hash values.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Data integrity.
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Reason about bits and bytes.

# RSA

- **RSA Basics:**
  - Public-key cryptography algorithm.
  - Based on prime factorization being hard.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Data confidentiality.
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Reason about numerical computing.

# RSA + SHA = BTC

- **Facilitating Blockchain:**
  - SHA & RSA in play
    - RSA: Keep wallet keys _confidential_
    - SHA: Maintain wallet content _integrity_
- But we need some techniques to implement...
  - Pointers & Recursion

# Blockchain

- **Blockchain:**
  - Blockchain structure resembles linked lists.
    - Linked lists use **pointers**
    - **Pointers** are used **recursively**
  - Pointers are validated with **SHA**
    - That is, they have integrity

# Merkle Trees

- **Merkle Trees:**
  - Tree structure using SHA for data integrity.
  - Hashes stored as nodes; pointers link them.
  - Leaf nodes are RSA signatures!
- Merkle Trees are **balanced**
  - We get to see a way to implement complex data structures in a low level language in a way that solves a real problem.

# Final

- **Implement Full-Custom BTC**
  - Under absolutely no circumstances use it
    - It'll be insecure for reasons out-of-scope
  - CS 540:
    - Must add some improvement
    - Must conduct evaluative experiments
    - Must document as a whitepaper

# Today

- &check; Introduce the course
  - &check; The C Programming Language
  - &check; Cryptography + Cryptocurrency
- Introduce the technologies
  - `podman`
  - `vim`
  - `gcc`
  - `git`

# What is Podman?

- **Definition:**
  - Platform to develop, ship, and run applications in isolated containers.
- **Benefits:**
  - Portability, consistency across environments.
- **Editorializing:**
  - Probably all code should be written in a container now that they exist.

# In practice:

- **Windows** only
  - Run `wsl --install -d ubuntu` command once
- **Windows+Mac:**
  - Use Podman Installer once
  - Launch Podman Desktop each time you code
  - Use `podman` commands
- **Linux:**
  - Have fun with your package manager.

# Circa ~2013

- **The problem:**
  - We want to run code.
  - We want the code to create programs
  - We want the programs to work on more than one computer.
- **The solution:**
  - Realistically, the Java Virtual Machine
  - But then you have to write Java (this is pre-Scala, pre-Kotlin)
  
  
# Circa ~2008

- **The setting:**
  - Cloud is taking off, mainly Amazon + Google
  - They already have to run everything in virtual machine.
  - They needed a lightweight solution.
- **The solution:**
  - Docker is written in the Google C-like, Go
  - It is a lightweight pretend computer.
  
# Docker&rarr;Podman

- Docker is closed-source (bad)
- Docker is critical infastructre in most code bases
- The Redhat team (from <span style="color:#4B9CD3">CAROLINA</span>) stepped into solve the problem
- They make Podman - completely compatible, completely open-source
- We use Podman in this class

# Podman

- Podman solves the problem of writing code on one computer and running it another.
- Simply specify a Podman image
  - a description of a imaginary computer
- Podman will pretend to be that computer
- We can run code "inside" Podman
  - Code in the container can't tell it's running inside Podman

# Podman & Python

- **Windows, Mac, Linux:**
  - Win tends to refer to Python3 as "python"
  - Mac tends to refer to Python2 as "python"
  - Linux, because its good, makes you specify:
  
```bash
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ python
Command 'python' not found, did you mean:
  command 'python3' from deb python3
  command 'python' from deb python-is-python3
```

# Bugs

- This can lead to bugs pretty quickly
  - Say I write and test a .py file on Mac
  - I email it to my prof for help
  - SyntaxError on my prof's Linux device:
  
```bash
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ python2 -c "print 'hello world'"
hello world
user@DESKTOP-THMS2PJ:~$ python3 -c "print 'hello world'"
  File "<string>", line 1
    print 'hello world'
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?
```

# Versioning

- Python2/3 is just an extreme example
  - Most of code reuse has versioning problems
  - Many CS1 headaches are Win/Mac python'ing
  - But really: everything breaks all the time
- Solution: Just run in podman:
```bash
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman run -it python:alpine python
Python 3.13.1 (main, Dec  4 2024, 20:31:31) [GCC 13.2.1 20240309] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("hello world")
hello world
>>> exit()
```

# Images

- Something we `podman run -it` is an _image_
  - It is a template that correspond to many possible pretend computers
  - I think of them like object oriented class
  - They define something that could be

# Containers

- Each time we run said command, we have a different _container_
  - They have different file systems
  - Things we install don't persist to future `run` instances.
  - I think of them like objects of a class
  - Like '1' instead of 'integer'
  - They actually existing, running code.



# Today

  - &check; The C Programming Language
  - &check; Cryptography + Cryptocurrency
- Introduce the technologies
  - &check; `podman`
  - `vim`
  - `gcc`
  - `git`

# IDEs

- At some point in time, code started being written in IDEs.
  - Integrated design environments.
  - To me, the first one was Eclipse (for Java)
- VS Code is the ascendent IDE, and is everywhere.
  - Google Cloud has **browser based** VS Code clone
- VS Code has some nice things - including good `git` and `docker` (less so `podman`) integration.
  
  
# Integration

- VS Code has some nice things 
  - Works with `git`/`docker` (less so `podman`).
  - You know what else can do that?
  - The command line
  - Which you don't have to install
- IDEs are ~new, the was command line utilities
  - Vi(m)
  - Emacs
  - Nano
  
# Why Vim?

- While IDEs are ascendent...
  - The are not installed on every system
  - They can be hard to use in cloud
  - They can start costing money at any time
  - They seem slower and to produce worse code
- Like Python, IDEs are easy!
  - This is good for new coders
  - It is a design decision thereafter
  
# Vim

- Vim isn't too bad
  - It can basically be used as a keyboard navigated text editor.
  - It has really good keyboard shortcuts and modes that we learn over time.
  - It seems to be the pound-for-pound productivity champion of all time.
- It is hard to find people who have learned `vim` who don't prefer it.

# Podvim

- We can install and run `vim` inside a container (which happens to run Debian & &there4; `apt`)
- Even directly from Python...
```py
>>> import os
>>> os.system("apt update") # update the registry of packages
<blah blah blah>
>>> os.system("apt install vim -y") # -y saves us from having to say "yes" to any prompts
<blah blah blah>
>>> os.system("vim") # a vim window will open
```
- This is `vim` inside `python` inside `podman`
  - Don't do this, it's a proof-of-concept

# Vim
- It looks like this:
```bash
~               VIM - Vi IMproved
~                  version 9.1
~            by Bram Moolenaar et al.
~   Vim is open source and freely distributable
~
~          Become a registered Vim user!
~  type  :help register<Enter>   for information
~
~  type  :q<Enter>              to exit
~  type  :help<Enter>  or  <F1> for on-line help
~  type  :help version9<Enter>  for version info
```

# Usage

- I usually use vim as `vim filename.py`
  - When `vim` opens I type `i` (for "insert")
  - Then I write code.
  - ESC &rarr; `:x` &rarr; ENTER to save+quit
- Learn `vim` incrementally by using it for this class - for code, for notes, for whatever.


# Today

- &check; Introduce the course
  - &check; The C Programming Language
  - &check; Cryptography + Cryptocurrency
- Introduce the technologies
  - &check; `podman`
  - &check; `vim`
  - `gcc`
  - `git`

# GCC

- Developed for the C language to make an open source operating system in 1987.
- Mainly around today for the C language to make an open source operating system (Linux)
- (The C language was invented to write an operating system).
- `python` is written in GCC C
```python
C:\Users\cd-desk>podman run -it python
Python 3.13.1 (main, Dec  4 2024, 20:40:27) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
```

# Great freeware

- Many legendary programs created using GCC:
  - HTTPD & NGINX, which serve a majority of webtraffic
  - Every major Linux and FreeBSD distribution
  - Major browsers like Firefox and Chromium
    - Firefox is on `clang` now but that's new
  - GNU Bash and Coreutils, like `cat`, `ls`, `rm`
  - Bitcoin Core
  
# Compilation

- Like `python` or `podman` or `vim`, GCC is a command - `gcc`
- `gcc` takes at least one argument: a filename, usually of a C file
- GCC takes this C file and makes an executable 
  - a program, sort of
- Executables run as command with `./` prefix
  - This differs from `python` which runs a script **without** creating a corresponding program.

# .py vs .c

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly

  A(Python) --> B[fname.py file]
  B --> C[python fname.py]
  C --> D{hello world}
  E(C) --> F[fname.c  file]
  F --> G[gcc fname.c -o ename]
  G --> H[./ename]
  H --> I{hello world}
```

- _You only have to compile once to have the executable forever._
- _Most programs are executables, not scripts._

# Today

- &check; Introduce the course
  - &check; The C Programming Language
  - &check; Cryptography + Cryptocurrency
- Introduce the technologies
  - &check; `podman`
  - &check; `vim`
  - &check; `gcc`
  - `git`
  
# Git

<ul>
<li> Git was invented... to store the C language source code for an open source operating system (Linux)</li>
<li> It is de facto the only way in the universe to store code other than "on my HDD/SSD"</li>
<li> It is also a very good way to
    <ul>
    <ol>
    <li> Keep track of podman images</li>
    <li> Keep track of podman containers</li>
    <li> Keep track of code used inside containers</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
</li>

# As a command

- Git corresponds, like the others, to a command: `git`
  - It is common now to use other techniques, but the command remains extremely **stable**
- Quoth GitHub, the first and greatest of the collaboration tools:

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/connecting-to-github"><blockquote>
If you want a lot of control and flexibility, you can use the command line.
</blockquote></a>


# As a technology

- So basically, you have things called repositories or "repos"

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(My ️‍🔥 code repo)
```

# As a technology

- Then you realize you wrote an infinite loop so you update it

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(My ️‍🔥 code repo v0 ) --> B(My ️‍🔥 code repo v1)
```

# As a technology

- Then you come to class and realize your code is on your gaming rig in your apartment.

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(<s>My ️‍🔥 code repo v0</s>) --> B(<s>My ️‍🔥 code repo v1</s>)
```

# As a technology

- So you save your code on GitHub
  - GH = GitHub, GR = Gaming Rig

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GH.‍🔥 v0)
```

# As a technology

- But you realize you didn't sanitize your inputs so you update again.

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
```

# As a technology

- Then you have class again and grab the GitHub version onto your LT = Laptop

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
  D --> E(LT.‍🔥 v0)
```

# As a technology

- You notice it has the bug so you fix it again on your laptop in almost the same way

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
  D --> E(LT.‍🔥 v0)
  E --> F(LT.‍🔥 v1)
```

# As a technology

- And save that back to GitHub then head back home to play Nethack on your 12000USD Gaming PC

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
  D --> E(LT.‍🔥 v0)
  E --> F(LT.‍🔥 v1)
  F --> G(GH.‍🔥 v1)
```

# As a technology

- You realize you also added some ASCII art and try to send that to GitHub

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
  D --> E(LT.‍🔥 v0)
  E --> F(LT.‍🔥 v1)
  F --> G(GH.‍🔥 v1)
  G --> H(GH.‍🔥 v2)
  C --> H
```

# As a technology

- Two arrows into one thing is a merge conflict and out-of-scope for now.

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
  D --> E(LT.‍🔥 v0)
  E --> F(LT.‍🔥 v1)
  F --> G(GH.‍🔥 v1)
  G --> H{💥}
  C --> H
```

# As a technology

- Basically versions of code can live in more than one place.
  - Ah, versions, our old friend...

```{mermaid}
%%| theme: Darkly
flowchart LR
  A(GR.️‍🔥 v0) --> B(GR.️‍🔥 v1)
  B --> C(GR.️‍🔥 v2)
  B --> D(GH.‍🔥 v0)
  D --> E(LT.‍🔥 v0)
  E --> F(LT.‍🔥 v1)
  F --> G(GH.‍🔥 v1)
  G --> H{💥}
  C --> H
```

# In Brief

- Generally create repositories + tokens in browser
- Use command line and use 'git clone <name>' once.
- Authenticate via access token from browser
- Then use 'git add', 'git commit', 'git push' to save work
- Use 'git pull' to grab saved work
- Use a ".gitignore" file so only code (**NOT** executables) live on GitHub
