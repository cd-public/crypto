					<h3>Course Description</h3>
					<p>Cybersecurity can be understood as a mindset or approach rather than a subfield of computer science, such as secure mobile computing, network and operating system security, secure data bases, and secure cryptography algorithms. This course prepares a general audience to incorporate security concepts and ethics into their daily lives and offers some basic familiarity with writing security oriented code.  
					<hr>
					<h3>Optional Reference Texts</h3>
					<p><i><a href="https://courses.physics.ucsd.edu/2014/Winter/physics141/Labs/Lab1/The_C_Programming_Language.pdf">The C Programming Language</a></i> Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie</p>

					<hr>
                    <h3>Assignments and Assessment</h3>
					<p>Assessment will be structured over attendance, homeworks, a midterm exam, and a final project.
                    <ul>
						<li>Homeworks will be assessed on a binary scale for feedback only.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>I will provide what I hope to be a complete specification for a code base.
							</li><li>I will build and execute the code in a predefined environment.
							</li><li>I will compare the functionality with a reference solution.
						</li></ul>
						<li>A midterm exam will be administered in a proctored, in-person setting.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>I will design a midterm and rubric to best assess my teaching quality.
                            <li>I reserve the right to make curricular changes following the midterm.
						</li></ul>
						<li>A final project on systems research will be assigned.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>I will evaluate the research contributions as I would in academic peer review.
							</li><li>I will provide peer review feedback in lieu of letter grades.
						</li></ul>
						<li>Here are what letter grades mean to me:</li>
						<ul><li><strong>A</strong>: Student critically engaged with core learning objectives.
							</li><li><strong>B</strong>: Student did not provide evidence of critical engagement with learning objectives.
							</li><li><strong>F</strong>: Student was disruptive or did not meaningfully participate the course.
						</li></ul>
                        <li>Students active and engaged in 11 of 14 or more sessions may anticipate an A.
                        <li>Missing 3+ classes without a "good excuse" is an F under SCIS policy.
                        <ul>
                            <li>YouTube attendance is accepted for my course.
                            <li>In the event of recording failures, slide review with email notice is appropriate.
                    </ul>

					<h3>Student Learning Objectives:</h3>
					<p>Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
					<ul>
						<li>Differentiate confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
						<li>Apply modular arithmetic to computational systems.
						<li>Apply recursion and a pointers to programming problems.
						<li>Articulate the impossibility of distributed consensus.
                        <li>Understand a low-level systems programming language and its uses.
                    </ul>
                    <p>This course is decomposed structurally into two modules: a module on crytography, which explores mathematics, principles of cybersecurity, and beginning usage of a low-level systems programming language, and a module on cryptocurrency, which explores advanced algorithmic problems of recursion and distribution consensus and the applications of systems programming.
					<hr>
					<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
					<p><b>Late work</b> is not accepted.
					<p>I reserve the right to extend deadlines to the entire class, in the students' favor, at any time.
                    <p>The purpose of the policy is learning-oriented rather than assessment oriented, so as a rule exceptions are not granted even in the case of a "good excuse" - the best learning outcome is almost always to turn in partially complete assignments and start the next assignment early.
					<hr>
					<h3>On Academic Honesty</h3>
					<p>Write your assignments yourself and cite what resources you used.
					<h4>Online Resources Policy</h4>
					<p>Use of online resources -  such as Stack Overflow, W3Schools, Wikipedia, GeeksforGeeks, Github, Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok - is permitted on assignments in this course.
					<h4>Collaboration Policy</h4>
					<p>Collaboration with peers is permitted on assignments in this course. You are responsible for ensuring that peers are comfortable working with you via enthusiastic consent. Simply put, enthusiastic consent means looking for the presence of a “yes” rather than the absence of a “no.”
					<h4>AI Policy</h4>
					<p>AI usage is permitted on assignments in this course. AI is signficantly less mature at systems programming than at scripting, such as in Python or JavaScript, and its usage is not encourage (or discouraged) in this course.

					<h2>College Policies</h2>
					<p>The following material is adapted from “Information for Syllabus” recommended language on syllabus prepartion provided to instructors in the College of Arts & Sciences and represents the views of the instructor's employer other than minor edits for clarity and sensativity.
					<hr>
					<h3>Time Commitment</h3>
					<p>Willamette’s Credit Hour Policy holds that for every hour of class time there is an expectation of 2-3 hours’ work outside of class. Thus, for this class you should anticipate spending 9-12 hours outside of class engaged in course-related activities. Examples include reading course materials, preparing for discussion, preparing and writing papers and exams.
					<hr>
					<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
					<p>Students of Willamette University are members of a community that values excellence and integrity in every aspect of life. As such, we expect all community members to live up to the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct. Students are expected not to engage in any type of academic or intellectually dishonest practice and encouraged to display honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in all they do. Plagiarism and cheating are especially offensive to the integrity of courses in which they occur and against the College community as a whole. These acts involve intellectual dishonesty, deception, and fraud, which inhibit the honest exchange of ideas. Plagiarism and cheating may be grounds for failure in the course and/or dismissal from the College. <a href="https://my.willamette.edu/sites/policies/page/63">Read more</a>.
					<hr>
					<h3>Classroom Conduct</h3>
					<p>As an educational institution, the College of Arts & Sciences  is committed to supporting the ideals and standards that help create a constructive and healthy learning community. That requires, among other things, encouraging positive classroom behaviors, discouraging disruptive classroom behaviors, and setting clear standards for both of those things.
					<p>Constructive classroom behaviors are those that support learners and teachers in an environment that promotes trust, respect, and collaborative learning.
					<p>Disruptive classroom behaviors are those that undermine or interfere with the abilities to learn and to teach. Clear examples of disruptive behaviors include, but are not limited to: interrupting others or persistently speaking out of turn; distracting the class from the subject matter or discussion at hand; making unauthorized recordings or photos of a class meeting or discussion (except as permitted as part of an Accessible Education Services-mandated accommodations); and in extreme cases, any physical threat, physical, psychological, sexual harassment, ridicule, or abusive act towards a student, staff member, or instructor in a classroom or related setting.

					<h3>Trans Inclusion and Gender Justice</h3>
					<p>I am always appreciative of the opportunity to address you by your preferred/affirming name, pronouns, and any other gender or identity markers. Please advise me of this at any point in the semester so that I may may best respect you at all times.
					<p>If I ever misgender or misidentify you in any way, I would greatly appreciate that you let me know, in whatever manner makes you comfortable, so that I can correct my error and work to repair any harm I have caused you.
					<hr>
					<h3>Religious Practices</h3>
					<p>I am always appreciative of the opportunity to work with you to achieve the best possible accommodation for your religious practice. Please let me about course conflicts with holy days or any other religious practice so we can work together to achieve an ideal outcome.

					<h3>Diversity and Disability Statement</h3>
					<p>Willamette University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. My goal is to create a learning environment that is usable, equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment or achievement, please notify me as soon as possible. Students with disabilities are also encouraged to contact the Accessible Education Services office in Smullin 155 at 503-370-6737 or <a href="accessible-info@willamette.edu">accessible-info@willamette.edu</a> to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in the course, including accommodations.
					<hr>
					<h3>SOAR Center Offerings: Food, Clothing, and School Materials</h3>
					<p>The Students Organizing for Access to Resources (SOAR) Center provides free, confidential, and equitable access to food, toiletries, professional clothing, textbooks and scholarly resources for all WU and WU-affiliated students. The SOAR Center is located on the Putnam University Center’s third floor. The space houses the Bearcat Pantry, Clothing Share, and First-Generation Book Drive and is maintained by committed students and advisors. Please check www.willamette.edu/go/soar for current hours of operation and email <a href="soar-center@willamette.edu">soar-center@willamette.edu</a> for any questions or concerns.
					<hr>
					<h3>Handle with Care Policy</h3>
					<p>If you have a day that you are able to be in class but feel that you cannot participate and engage as you usually do, all you need to tell me at the start of class is “handle with care.” You can do this via an email, a direct message via zoom, a note left on my desk, or a quick, private verbal exchange at the start of class. 
					<p>What asking to be handled with care means for class: You will not be called on (I do not call on people that are not volunteering as a general rule, but I want to remind you of that fact). You will not be asked to turn on your camera if we are meeting via Zoom. You will not be asked to provide any information or context. I do not need to know why you need to be handled with care, but here are some examples of why you might ask to be handled with care:
					<ul>
						<li>Illness
						<li>Stress/Anxiety
						<li>Things happening at home within your community
						<li>Things happening with your partner/break up
						<li>Things happening within your school family/Willamette community
					</ul>
					<p>If we are completing small group work and a student requests engagement from a group member and gets the response “handle with care,” all group members must respect that request and may not ask any follow up questions.
					<p>I have this policy because I know that it can sometimes be hard to be in class but it may be even more stressful to miss class. Also, sometimes class can be a welcome distraction when you have negative things going on so you want to go to class but are worried about holding it together if participating/engaging.
